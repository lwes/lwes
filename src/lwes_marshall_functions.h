/*! \brief Unmarshall a long string from a byte array
 *
 * Attempt to unmarshall aString from the given byte array at the
 * given offset, without overflowing the bound.  If the bound would be
 * overflown, an error is returned.
 *
 * The max_string_length is the maximum length of the passed in string.
 *
 * The length should be the total length of the array.
 *
 * The offset will be modified by the number of bytes consumed, and that value
 * will be returned.  Thus a value of 0 is an error, meaning not enough
 * bytes to fill out the given type.
