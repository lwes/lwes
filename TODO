For next major version bump
---------------------------

- Create typedef's for structures and replace all struct * instances with
  those typedefs
- Use enumeration for event types and not _TOKEN values
- rename time functions to be correct
- rename string fuctions to be correct
- make strings const in marshall functions (this may be able to be done
  in a minor version bump, since it may be binary compatible).
- remove BODY_LENGTH and HEADER_LENGTH from lwes_types.h
